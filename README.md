## Welcome to my portfolio.
This desighn was inspired by the playstation 5 menu. If you aren't a gamer , no worries. This list of directions will help you navigate with no issues.
## Navigation

## Main page Navigation
Once you've entered the main page, you will see a small list of game titles. The first three game titles with show you my contact info and experience in coding and all the languages I currently know. The last two game titles are the titles of the games I've made myself recently. Follow the simple instructions of copying my git link to access my code to play the game. I hope you enjoy them.

Last but not least , if you want to go back to home page jus tsimple click on the profile picture on the top right hand corner.
